# PwC-Showcase

This github represents a variety of coding and visulization work done by me.

1. Here you'll find code for my financial management tool, built for our Y2 Programming Course. The tool is text based, and is able to read and visualize a CSV-based Excel file, with financial transactions. It cleans and sorts the relevant data from the file insuring good data quality and provides the user with a clear picture of the money transactions. It's also able to group transactions and as an extra calculating how much a student can earn until they need to contact KELA.

The project is relatively simple, but provides a example into how I've used Python in prosessing Excel data and providing the end-user with a clear visulization that can be used for decision making. During the project, I found good areas of improvement and I'm working to make a more efficent version of the program on my freetime
